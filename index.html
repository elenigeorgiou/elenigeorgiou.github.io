According to a TechCrunch article by Alex Wilhelm and Alexia Tsotsis, well-known programmer Julie Horvath joined GitHub back in the year 2012. Initially, GitHub was a small<br>startup that was quite supportive of its female developers. However, she could not get used to the aggressive communication from her male colleagues that had been the norm<br>since the majority of the company was up to that point. As the company grew, Horvath felt that her work was not truly valued due to her gender. Having rejected a date, <br>unnecessary competition was created between the Horvath and the other engineer. The male engineer “ripped out (Horvath’s) code”  without giving her any credit. This toxic <br>culture continued to develop at Github as a result of no action by management. <br>
<br>
A duty-based ethical framework can be applied to this situation. Horvath claims that she was supportive of GitHub’s positive culture to feminists throughout her two-year-long<br> employment. Despite her claims that she was being harassed by upper-management, Horvath could have been silent about her situation as she must have felt an obligation to <br>support her company. Her silence and support of the company hid her discrimination, allowing it to continue.<br>
<br>

As discussed in Fowler’s article about women’s representation in Uber, the company failed to keep a women-welcoming organization as the company grew.  From the anecdotes told <br>by #ubersurvivors, the organization had a culture that sexualized women that was encouraged by upper management. By the time Fowler had quit Uber, women percentage in the <br>organization had dropped from 25% to 3%. With no changes stemming from management, the culture can only get worse because the entire industry suffers from the same issue. 7 <br>out of 10 women in tech startups report sexual harassment, while just 35 percent of men agree (Weisul). Uber only became proactive about women after they were criticized about<br> their environment and as a result, started to create programs. Through a consequentialist framework, the culture will continue to falter until management changes to ensure <br>it does not reflect poorly on the company as many consumers will not want to support a company that is discriminatory.<br>

Bob could have acted this way due to an egotistical character flaw. He might have assumed that his coding skills were superior to <br>Alice’s and therefore, his code should be implemented instead of hers. This places Carlos in a difficult position in this disagreement <br> as he believes in Alice’s ability to code. He perhaps even feels more comfortable working with Alice because Bob does not <br>collaborate well. Alice may feel that Bob’s actions were unfair and that he was too quick to assume her code was inadequate. Even if <br> the genders of the individuals were switched, if Bob is inherently an egotistical person, this same scenario can arise. There is also <br> the chance that Bob was more provoked to not accept Alice’s code due to false assumptions that gender affects her abilities to code.<br>
<br>
This sort of incident can affect both the relationships within the group and harm their individual self-confidence. Alice might feel<br>like she is not good enough or likes an “imposter” by Bob for not accepting her code.  Bob may even feel hurt as well for being <br>isolated, and not being able to understand code he’s told is clear and correct.<br>
<br>
The long term effects of this incident may deteriorate interpersonal communication. Alice and Carlos might feel that Bob is unlikely to <br> accept their future ideas because Bob was quick to demonstrate that he could completely dismiss someone’s work and ideas. <br>Furthermore, the group might not be as productive due to trust issues between members. <br>
<br>
Bob should let Alice explain her code, perhaps by adding better comments. He should apologize for being quick to judge and be <br>open-minded when listening to Alice’s explanation. In an attempt to make the code better, Alice and Bob could merge their code or test<br> to see which one is better.  In order for the group to remain productive, it is crucial for Bob to integrate into Alice’s code and <br>put ego aside. Carlos could step in and offer a different explanation of Alice’s code. All three members can take steps to better <br>communicate their roles in order to improve productivity and avoid coding something twice unnecessarily.<br>

Sexual consent is the mutual agreement between two partners at all points during sexual activity (Rainn). Ideally, <br> the agreement should be clearly given verbally between any two partners. Depending on the situation, such as a <br> long-term relationship, there can be clear physical cues to show the comfort level. However, consent becomes hazy <br>when there is hesitant action, alcohol involved, or nonverbal cues. Did she say yes? I think she did… When situations <br>arise where the victim is intimidated or agreement is forced, “consent” does not count. In random hookups or new <br>relationships, consent needs to be clear because the relationship and limits have not been defined. <br> <br>

A popular #MeToo case corresponds with the recent appointment of Judge Kavanaugh who was accused by Blasey Ford of sexual<br> assault while he was at a college party at Yale. When Kavanaugh was appointed to Supreme Court, Ford realized her <br>responsibility to the American public to share what she knows about his character before being put in a lifetime position<br> of power (Gay, Fandos). The motive of Kavanaugh of denying his actions is an example of loss aversion -- he does not <br> want to lose his position or reputation. He denied accusations because he believes he is qualified despite mistakes <br>that happened over 25 years ago. <br><br>

Recently, apps like Good2Go and Legal Fling have been developed and released to address the pressing issue of sexual <br>assault (Hess, Zarya). While there are technicalities that may hinder the trustworthiness of these apps in court, they <br>provide a jumping off point to start the conversation. Social media like Twitter and Youtube have also assisted with the <br> #MeToo conversation by empowering anyone to share their stories and bring previous assaults into the public <br>spotlight. These platforms have their caveats -- “victims” may present false information, which would saturate these <br>platforms with misleading information that detracts from the original intent of the #MeToo movement. While there is no <br>single solution that can solve any sexual assault case, technology has certainly made the conversation about sexual <br>assault relevant and streamlined the path to justice for true victims. <br><br>
