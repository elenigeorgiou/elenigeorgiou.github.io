As a computer scientist, one must consider the effects of their work on individuals, the company, and society as a whole. The products we create could have a lasting impact on society from data collection to artificial intelligence. As society approaches new technological territory and the capability of what we can do expands, computer scientists must tread with caution as they pave the way for ethics in this new realm.  </p>
<b> Okay, great. How? </b>
<p>
Fortunately, there are small things everyday computer scientists should do to maintain high ethical standards. One may ask itself - am I doing this being I was told to or because I believe it is truly right? The following are points to be considered and followed to guide ethical decision making in your work.  

<ol>1. As a computer scientist, you will most certainly be working in a team. Be respectful to your colleagues and create a welcoming environment. The best product is cultivated in a well-cohesive group with a diverse pool of thoughts. Do your best to communicate with your peers and be conscious of any microaggressions you might be saying, whether it be intentional or unintentional. </ol>
<ol>2. The safety, well-being, and privacy of your users is paramount. The users’ well-being should alway be put ahead of profits or other company motives that may neglect the user. Furthermore, be fair and do not discriminate against your users. Make sure you are representative of your users while testing and rolling out new products. </ol>
<ol>3. Obey the laws to the best of your ability. When choosing between management orders and the laws, you should eir towards the side of the law. Further action should also often be made, such as following Europe's GPR for data collection even if you are a US company. Following standardized guidelines and laws helps create transparency with the public.</ol>
<ol>4. Do not purposely lie or deceive the public or management. Be explicit to your clients with what you are doing, even if it involves admitting failure. Not only is fraud illegal, it can cause serious breaches in trust both within the company and with outside users. Even lying about small numbers or the amount of work done can cause significant complications down the line. If pressured to lie by management or incentivized to lie to protect one’s job, you should put honesty first (even if the consequences seem too much in the short-run). Losing a job is a small price to pay to avoid the serious reprimandations of breaking the law.</ol>
<ol>5. Don’t fall into routine; always think as an individual. Just because everyone else is acting a certain way, does not mean it is right. Don’t be afraid to stand up for what you believe in, even if it has strong implications. By holding a high standard for yourself and those around, the highest quality material will be produced. </ol>
<ol>6. Be loyal to your employer whenever possible. You have an obligation to serve them to your best abilities. This does not condone committing actions at the expense of clients, the law, or your own close values. However, employers are paying you to work for them so refusing to follow guidelines or orders without significant reasoning is unfair to the employer.</ol>

<br>
As ethics is a very complicated subject matter and no ethical framework can ever be perfectly applied to every situation, this Code of Ethics is only a set of guidelines. As much as we’d love to solve every ethical dilemma in only 500 words, the best we can do is create rules to help guide people along to the most ethical decisions in any scenario. But merely following guidelines will not produce the best outcome, both knowledge and independent thought/actions are required. It is on each of us to actively think about our situation and analyze what our best actions are in order to be as ethical as we can be.

Gamification is taking advantage of human motivation from games and applying it in other activities or apps. Whether in real-life use or application development, gamification is potent enough to allow users to stick to the service or activity longer than if it wasn’t gamified. Instead of being purely function-focused and hyper-efficient, they are much more psychologically-oriented to keep your attention. It can be as simple as collecting daily streaks in Snapchat, or as complex as managing an entire leveling system in Habitica (an RPG-inspired to-do list app).
</p> <p>
In many ways, gamification can be a positive force. For example, you can gamify your life in order to get past psychological hurdles or boundaries in order to achieve your goals. This can range from achieving personal life goals like consistently getting into a good habit to getting over fears and other mental challenges. As an example, take Nike’s running app, Nike+. By taking advantage of our competitiveness, it pushes us to beat our previous running records each day. Or take Duolingo, which utilizes daily streaks, experience, badges, and power-ups to keep people engaged while learning languages.
</p>
<p>
However, just like any tool, gamification can also be negatively used. Mobile apps such as FarmVille exemplify this, as they’re not exactly something that most people find fun, but they have exploited human behaviorism to get people addicted. In the case of FarmVille, it ensures you stick around by making you feel ownership over the farm you have been building and providing a limited progression system that keeps people playing in short bursts before their interest wanes during each play session. But this is not only limited to games, as many companies and products we use utilize gamification, like our phones, laptops, TVs, etc by getting the brain to flood with positive endorphins at every action we take, keeping us glued to our screens.

Artificial Intelligence provides our society tools ranging from individual assistance to solutions to large-scale problems including banking regulation and policing. AI is a useful tool when the utility from the insight that it generates outweighs the cost to acquire the data. For example, using an AI voice assistant such as Google Assistant or Alexa offers many features that can simplify one's life at the cost of allowing Google and Amazon to collect data about your internet searchers, preferences, and spending habits. However, an example where using AI could bring more negative consequences than positive is the Facebook newsfeed ranking scandal that emerged during the 2016 presidential elections. Facebook’s AI algorithm sparked controversy because it favored content coming from extremist sources, an unintended consequence of AI, which in this case can influence an entire country’s election process.
</p> <p>The solutions proposed thus far offer good starting points to alleviate some of the problems that arise with AI. These include incorporating bias testing to test the algorithm’s blind spots and increasing the diversity among the creators to reflect thoughts of more types of people. Though the solutions pinpoint two major problem areas with AI, there will still be implicit bias embedded in these systems. Computer scientists have an ethical responsibility to become aware of the situation at hand and proceed with measures to try to combat the related problems so unintended consequences will not occur. Through a consequentialist viewpoint, it is in the best interest for all computer scientists to become aware of biases they might be introducing into their code, even if it might not be AI-related. 
</p>
<p>
As the builders of the technology for the future, everyone involved in the product development process and release is susceptible to ethical fading and incrementalism. It is important to be not only cognisant the materials are sourced but how materials are sourced and passed down the supply chain. For example, an executive board member of a large clothing manufacturer may practice consequentialism and not consider human labor violations happening in the factories making the garments. Duty-based ethics may be utilized to combat incrementalism. One could ask oneself “is still the right thing to do” to not fall off a slippery slope by accepting a lower and lower standard of ethics over time.

Recently, the concept of hacktivism has gained massive traction as our continual use of technology has increased. Hacktivism has affected many aspects of people’s lives, both on a societal and individual level.
<br><br>
From a societal standpoint, hacktivism has had a large part in domestic politics and impacted many influential and wealthy people. For example, it was exposed that many wealthy people were hiding money offshores in the Panama Papers data leak. In some ways, it is beneficial to society to have these hacktivists publicize this information and allow for the free flow of information. This is further seen in the activities of cyberactivists in Arab countries for freedom of speech and freedom from oppression, or from Edward Snowden’s work on government surveillance programs. 
<br><br>
On the other side however, hacktivism is can be harmful to the individual when it is targeted against them. For example, despite it being  justified in some way to publicize the data information of the Ashley Madison affair business, the individuals who wanted to keep their data secret will now have to face the consequences of their choices. Similarly, if a user’s data that they expect to keep private is made public, then that is clearly harmful to that user.
<br><br>
Deciding strict criteria for when hacktivism is ethical and when it is not is likely impossible. It’s difficult to make blanket statements on the actions of hacktivists when their goals	 and motives vary so much. Some might want to benefit society in a way they think is good. Others may just want to further their own positions. It’s not merely black or white as what’s good for one group may be terrible for another. The presence of these ambiguous virtue frameworks of hacktivists means that we as a society have to exam hacktivist actions on a case-by-case basis to determine if we deem it more morally good than bad. Even then, not everyone will be satisfied.

	In the past few years, data collection in software has gotten a lot of attention. The acceptable line of data collection for convenience occurs when it goes beyond the scope of what a consumer agrees to. The tech industry plays a major part in this question as companies create applications that can harvest and use individuals’ personal information. Companies must decide how to use data they collect. 
<br><br>

By trading software access and information for personal data, individuals benefit from the convenience that applications create. For instance, from a consequentialist standpoint, by allowing Location Services, Google can offer you more intelligent recommendations such as show you where you parked your car or give suggestions for restaurants. However, individuals might feel that their privacy is compromised and that their information is being exploited which could pose security issues. There are always unintentional consequences that arise --- on a societal scale, data that gets into the wrong hands could be used maliciously. Because of this trade-off, society must decide how we want to deal with the data.  
<br><br>
There has been a lot of debate over data privacy and who should own personal data. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a data protection policy enforced by the European Union that sets guidelines regarding the collection and processing of personal data for individuals in the EU. GDPR has made headlines the past few years about attempting to set boundaries on how companies can use people’s personal data. Our group believes that companies should disclose to their consumers how their data is being collected and used, and offer to delete the data if the consumer does not consent to these practices.
<br><br>
As specified on the GDPR website, data privacy consent is informed and specific. Customers should know the data controller’s identity, what kind of data it will process, how it will be used, and be informed about their right to withdraw consent at any time. Informed consent means that the data-controlling agent must disclose the motivation behind getting personal data and receive the consumer’s consent prior to collecting data; additionally, revoking consent should be just as easy as giving it.

Software piracy does more bad than good. The ones that benefit short-term from piracy are only the individuals that choose to use it. These individuals that pirate software don’t realize the larger long-term impact on the product itself, the company, people in the company, and other genuine customers. 
<br><br>
People justify piracy to themselves because they think the money from just their copy of the game is so insignificant that it will barely affect the development company that they are ripping off. Especially for a small price tag on a game like Game Dev Tycoon, one small sale couldn’t possible harm the developers in their mind. They fail to realize however that everyone pirating the game adds up, and can make a significant dent in the sales margin of a game or other digital medium.  The consequences that arise from piracy include potentially bankrupting the company and stopping the product from being developed further. This in turn could lead to more ads to pay off the cost of producing the game or the increase of annoying pay-to-play mechanics.  
<br><br>
Technology has made piracy very easy and accessible. Anyone with a internet connection and computer can download games and watch movies/shows for no cost. Through the use of VPN and proxies, people can avoid getting in trouble with law officials and game/movie publishers. The ease of access and distribution that technology provides is essentially what makes the profit loss for software development companies stack up. For the individuals who pirate, their thinking might align with a virtue based framework in the sense that they are giving access to individuals who genuinely cannot afford a particular piece of software. However, individuals how can afford a piece of software should pay for it according to a consequentialist framework, as their decisions can cumulatively have a substantial impact. Excessive piracy may result in companies raising the average cost of game to make up for the losses due to illegal sharing of their game.

Youtube has a responsibility to provide an enjoyable platform that allows users to watch and share videos freely, while still upholding company policies. Their responsibility to advertisers is to provide advertising space that is not associated with content that hurts their image. 
<br><br>
The content on YouTube is a responsibility of both the platforms content creators and YouTube itself. The conversation about YouTube’s content is largely controlled by the creators who use YouTube to publish and monetize their content.  These creators discuss YouTube’s practices of demonetization and censorship on their content, bringing awareness of the situation from a creator’s perspective. Framing the discussion from a creator’s point of view allows for alternate framing of the situation, from that of advertisers and from YouTube itself. 
<br><br>
Advertisers have a right to keep their name away from content that could be harmful or controversial to themselves, while YouTube has a responsibility to uphold this right in order to keep its content monetized and funded. Since Youtube does not want to lose their clients which provide company revenue, they tend to demonetize videos even if they are slightly questionable. Google’s fundamental goal is to make correct information available to others, thus Youtube should not make money off videos that misinform and spread fake news.
<br><br>
Youtube’s profit model is based on a duty-based ethical framework as it finds a good balance between balancing having a platform that content can be freely shared while acknowledging capitalism and advertisers needs. YouTube has demonetized Alex Jones’ channel, InfoWars after he posted several extremely controversial videos. Demonetization was an appropriate action as it punishes Jones for spreading blatant misinformation and hurtful messages throughout the internet. And though several content creators have reported that YouTube has wrongly demonetized their videos for no reason, Youtube can work to fix these issues.

According to a New York Times article by Ceylan Yeginsu, Amazon has developed wristbands that track the productivity<br> of its factory workers. In general, the wristband concept is not unethical. From a consequentialist framework, <br>Amazon is simply smoothening out human inefficiencies in its factories. The bracelets are assisting workers with <br>their labor and highlighting which workers may be wasting company resources by being idle.  However, the possible<br> applications Amazon can use the wristband for are potentially unethical.  Amazon claims the wristbands are <br>designed to assist the workers in locating a package through haptic feedback, however, the technology required to do<br> this forces Amazon to track their employees’ every move.  This would be an invasion of employees’ privacy and <br>could lead to unethical oversight of employees.  Amazon also has ten percent of its Ohio employees relying on food <br>stamps.  As a large business that receives outrageous tax breaks, Amazon has not only the financial ability but <br>also the duty to its community and employees to respect and keep food on the plates of the people who make <br>Amazon's efficiency possible.<br>
<br>
Our society enables Amazon because of capitalism; consumers want efficiency -- and Amazon provides just that. <br>Fulfilling this need for consumers, allows them to have a lot of freedom in doing what they want. However, as a <br>result of receiving business subsidies and tax-break incentives, Amazon has a duty to help the local community and <br>its economy. Based on a duty-based framework, Amazon’s role as a tech giant and influencer, Amazon has the duty <br>to give back to communities they have disrupted. Because Amazon has had free reign over the market, they have <br>caused many local businesses to go out of business. Amazon should find a way to support local businesses and <br>encourage their growth. <br>

Technology’s role has the potential to harm work culture and overall ethics of working conditions in the Amazon <br>warehouses. Although technology is helping workers become more efficient, it is also developing an environment where <br>workers feel like they are always under pressure and scrutiny. <br>

The Challenger Disaster is a prime example of a costly ethical decision that killed several astronauts.<br>The engineers that understood the complex technology gave warnings to their higher-ups. They understood <br>that a technical detail could have a major impact on the launch of the rocket and astronauts on board, <br>and as a result, decided to warn the executives through a duty-based value system. Despite giving strong <br>warnings (that were ignored), the engineers didn’t do anything more -- a consequentialist view since <br>any other actions could have resulted in the loss of a job. Though the engineers did good in warning <br>their superiors of the technical red flag, they succumbed to obedience over a higher authority -- an <br>action that is common in our society. <br>
<br>
Those that ultimately made the decision to launch the Challenger actively ignored warnings by the <br>engineers. The launch had already been delayed once, and the commanders did not want to waste any more<br> time. Furthermore, after the failed launch, the people in power failed to accept their faults. They simply <br>blamed Boisjoly for “airing the company’s dirty laundry’ in front of the whole country. ” They ignored <br>warnings by engineers and told the public the cause of the disaster was due to flaws in decision <br>making. This exemplifies the consequentialist framework of the ethical decision process. The selfish <br>attitudes of the upper management and their urge to report success caused them to ignore technical details <br> they did not understand. They risked human life and months of hard work for a few moments of glory. <br>

In situations such as these, it is quite imperative to listen to the advice of technical experts.

According to a TechCrunch article by Alex Wilhelm and Alexia Tsotsis, well-known programmer Julie Horvath joined GitHub back in the year 2012. Initially, GitHub was a small<br>startup that was quite supportive of its female developers. However, she could not get used to the aggressive communication from her male colleagues that had been the norm<br>since the majority of the company was up to that point. As the company grew, Horvath felt that her work was not truly valued due to her gender. Having rejected a date, <br>unnecessary competition was created between the Horvath and the other engineer. The male engineer “ripped out (Horvath’s) code”  without giving her any credit. This toxic <br>culture continued to develop at Github as a result of no action by management. <br>
<br>
A duty-based ethical framework can be applied to this situation. Horvath claims that she was supportive of GitHub’s positive culture to feminists throughout her two-year-long<br> employment. Despite her claims that she was being harassed by upper-management, Horvath could have been silent about her situation as she must have felt an obligation to <br>support her company. Her silence and support of the company hid her discrimination, allowing it to continue.<br>
<br>

As discussed in Fowler’s article about women’s representation in Uber, the company failed to keep a women-welcoming organization as the company grew.  From the anecdotes told <br>by #ubersurvivors, the organization had a culture that sexualized women that was encouraged by upper management. By the time Fowler had quit Uber, women percentage in the <br>organization had dropped from 25% to 3%. With no changes stemming from management, the culture can only get worse because the entire industry suffers from the same issue. 7 <br>out of 10 women in tech startups report sexual harassment, while just 35 percent of men agree (Weisul). Uber only became proactive about women after they were criticized about<br> their environment and as a result, started to create programs. Through a consequentialist framework, the culture will continue to falter until management changes to ensure <br>it does not reflect poorly on the company as many consumers will not want to support a company that is discriminatory.<br>

Bob could have acted this way due to an egotistical character flaw. He might have assumed that his coding skills were superior to <br>Alice’s and therefore, his code should be implemented instead of hers. This places Carlos in a difficult position in this disagreement <br> as he believes in Alice’s ability to code. He perhaps even feels more comfortable working with Alice because Bob does not <br>collaborate well. Alice may feel that Bob’s actions were unfair and that he was too quick to assume her code was inadequate. Even if <br> the genders of the individuals were switched, if Bob is inherently an egotistical person, this same scenario can arise. There is also <br> the chance that Bob was more provoked to not accept Alice’s code due to false assumptions that gender affects her abilities to code.<br>
<br>
This sort of incident can affect both the relationships within the group and harm their individual self-confidence. Alice might feel<br>like she is not good enough or likes an “imposter” by Bob for not accepting her code.  Bob may even feel hurt as well for being <br>isolated, and not being able to understand code he’s told is clear and correct.<br>
<br>
The long term effects of this incident may deteriorate interpersonal communication. Alice and Carlos might feel that Bob is unlikely to <br> accept their future ideas because Bob was quick to demonstrate that he could completely dismiss someone’s work and ideas. <br>Furthermore, the group might not be as productive due to trust issues between members. <br>
<br>
Bob should let Alice explain her code, perhaps by adding better comments. He should apologize for being quick to judge and be <br>open-minded when listening to Alice’s explanation. In an attempt to make the code better, Alice and Bob could merge their code or test<br> to see which one is better.  In order for the group to remain productive, it is crucial for Bob to integrate into Alice’s code and <br>put ego aside. Carlos could step in and offer a different explanation of Alice’s code. All three members can take steps to better <br>communicate their roles in order to improve productivity and avoid coding something twice unnecessarily.<br>

Sexual consent is the mutual agreement between two partners at all points during sexual activity (Rainn). Ideally, <br> the agreement should be clearly given verbally between any two partners. Depending on the situation, such as a <br> long-term relationship, there can be clear physical cues to show the comfort level. However, consent becomes hazy <br>when there is hesitant action, alcohol involved, or nonverbal cues. Did she say yes? I think she did… When situations <br>arise where the victim is intimidated or agreement is forced, “consent” does not count. In random hookups or new <br>relationships, consent needs to be clear because the relationship and limits have not been defined. <br> <br>

A popular #MeToo case corresponds with the recent appointment of Judge Kavanaugh who was accused by Blasey Ford of sexual<br> assault while he was at a college party at Yale. When Kavanaugh was appointed to Supreme Court, Ford realized her <br>responsibility to the American public to share what she knows about his character before being put in a lifetime position<br> of power (Gay, Fandos). The motive of Kavanaugh of denying his actions is an example of loss aversion -- he does not <br> want to lose his position or reputation. He denied accusations because he believes he is qualified despite mistakes <br>that happened over 25 years ago. <br><br>

Recently, apps like Good2Go and Legal Fling have been developed and released to address the pressing issue of sexual <br>assault (Hess, Zarya).

These platforms have their caveats -- “victims” may present false information, which would saturate these <br>platforms with misleading information that detracts from the original intent of the #MeToo movement. While there is no <br>single solution that can solve any sexual assault case, technology has certainly made the conversation about sexual <br>assault relevant and streamlined the path to justice for true victims. <br><br>
