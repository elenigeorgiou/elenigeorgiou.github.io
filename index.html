According to a New York Times article by Ceylan Yeginsu, Amazon has developed wristbands that track the productivity<br> of its factory workers. In general, the wristband concept is not unethical. From a consequentialist framework, <br>Amazon is simply smoothening out human inefficiencies in its factories. The bracelets are assisting workers with <br>their labor and highlighting which workers may be wasting company resources by being idle.  However, the possible<br> applications Amazon can use the wristband for are potentially unethical.  Amazon claims the wristbands are <br>designed to assist the workers in locating a package through haptic feedback, however, the technology required to do<br> this forces Amazon to track their employees’ every move.  This would be an invasion of employees’ privacy and <br>could lead to unethical oversight of employees.  Amazon also has ten percent of its Ohio employees relying on food <br>stamps.  As a large business that receives outrageous tax breaks, Amazon has not only the financial ability but <br>also the duty to its community and employees to respect and keep food on the plates of the people who make <br>Amazon's efficiency possible.<br>
<br>
Our society enables Amazon because of capitalism; consumers want efficiency -- and Amazon provides just that. <br>Fulfilling this need for consumers, allows them to have a lot of freedom in doing what they want. However, as a <br>result of receiving business subsidies and tax-break incentives, Amazon has a duty to help the local community and <br>its economy. Based on a duty-based framework, Amazon’s role as a tech giant and influencer, Amazon has the duty <br>to give back to communities they have disrupted. Because Amazon has had free reign over the market, they have <br>caused many local businesses to go out of business. Amazon should find a way to support local businesses and <br>encourage their growth. <br>

Technology’s role has the potential to harm work culture and overall ethics of working conditions in the Amazon <br>warehouses. Although technology is helping workers become more efficient, it is also developing an environment where <br>workers feel like they are always under pressure and scrutiny. <br>

The Challenger Disaster is a prime example of a costly ethical decision that killed several astronauts.<br>The engineers that understood the complex technology gave warnings to their higher-ups. They understood <br>that a technical detail could have a major impact on the launch of the rocket and astronauts on board, <br>and as a result, decided to warn the executives through a duty-based value system. Despite giving strong <br>warnings (that were ignored), the engineers didn’t do anything more -- a consequentialist view since <br>any other actions could have resulted in the loss of a job. Though the engineers did good in warning <br>their superiors of the technical red flag, they succumbed to obedience over a higher authority -- an <br>action that is common in our society. <br>
<br>
Those that ultimately made the decision to launch the Challenger actively ignored warnings by the <br>engineers. The launch had already been delayed once, and the commanders did not want to waste any more<br> time. Furthermore, after the failed launch, the people in power failed to accept their faults. They simply <br>blamed Boisjoly for “airing the company’s dirty laundry’ in front of the whole country. ” They ignored <br>warnings by engineers and told the public the cause of the disaster was due to flaws in decision <br>making. This exemplifies the consequentialist framework of the ethical decision process. The selfish <br>attitudes of the upper management and their urge to report success caused them to ignore technical details <br> they did not understand. They risked human life and months of hard work for a few moments of glory. <br> 
<br>
In situations such as these, it is quite imperative to listen to the advice of technical experts. For <br>NASA, individuals who coordinated the mission, including Morton Thiokol, to launch as soon as possible. <br>Utilizing a consequentialist framework, the hypothetical success they envisioned in the future would <br>ultimately justify their desire to rush Challenger’s launch, even when seven human <br>

According to a TechCrunch article by Alex Wilhelm and Alexia Tsotsis, well-known programmer Julie Horvath joined GitHub back in the year 2012. Initially, GitHub was a small<br>startup that was quite supportive of its female developers. However, she could not get used to the aggressive communication from her male colleagues that had been the norm<br>since the majority of the company was up to that point. As the company grew, Horvath felt that her work was not truly valued due to her gender. Having rejected a date, <br>unnecessary competition was created between the Horvath and the other engineer. The male engineer “ripped out (Horvath’s) code”  without giving her any credit. This toxic <br>culture continued to develop at Github as a result of no action by management. <br>
<br>
A duty-based ethical framework can be applied to this situation. Horvath claims that she was supportive of GitHub’s positive culture to feminists throughout her two-year-long<br> employment. Despite her claims that she was being harassed by upper-management, Horvath could have been silent about her situation as she must have felt an obligation to <br>support her company. Her silence and support of the company hid her discrimination, allowing it to continue.<br>
<br>

As discussed in Fowler’s article about women’s representation in Uber, the company failed to keep a women-welcoming organization as the company grew.  From the anecdotes told <br>by #ubersurvivors, the organization had a culture that sexualized women that was encouraged by upper management. By the time Fowler had quit Uber, women percentage in the <br>organization had dropped from 25% to 3%. With no changes stemming from management, the culture can only get worse because the entire industry suffers from the same issue. 7 <br>out of 10 women in tech startups report sexual harassment, while just 35 percent of men agree (Weisul). Uber only became proactive about women after they were criticized about<br> their environment and as a result, started to create programs. Through a consequentialist framework, the culture will continue to falter until management changes to ensure <br>it does not reflect poorly on the company as many consumers will not want to support a company that is discriminatory.<br>

Bob could have acted this way due to an egotistical character flaw. He might have assumed that his coding skills were superior to <br>Alice’s and therefore, his code should be implemented instead of hers. This places Carlos in a difficult position in this disagreement <br> as he believes in Alice’s ability to code. He perhaps even feels more comfortable working with Alice because Bob does not <br>collaborate well. Alice may feel that Bob’s actions were unfair and that he was too quick to assume her code was inadequate. Even if <br> the genders of the individuals were switched, if Bob is inherently an egotistical person, this same scenario can arise. There is also <br> the chance that Bob was more provoked to not accept Alice’s code due to false assumptions that gender affects her abilities to code.<br>
<br>
This sort of incident can affect both the relationships within the group and harm their individual self-confidence. Alice might feel<br>like she is not good enough or likes an “imposter” by Bob for not accepting her code.  Bob may even feel hurt as well for being <br>isolated, and not being able to understand code he’s told is clear and correct.<br>
<br>
The long term effects of this incident may deteriorate interpersonal communication. Alice and Carlos might feel that Bob is unlikely to <br> accept their future ideas because Bob was quick to demonstrate that he could completely dismiss someone’s work and ideas. <br>Furthermore, the group might not be as productive due to trust issues between members. <br>
<br>
Bob should let Alice explain her code, perhaps by adding better comments. He should apologize for being quick to judge and be <br>open-minded when listening to Alice’s explanation. In an attempt to make the code better, Alice and Bob could merge their code or test<br> to see which one is better.  In order for the group to remain productive, it is crucial for Bob to integrate into Alice’s code and <br>put ego aside. Carlos could step in and offer a different explanation of Alice’s code. All three members can take steps to better <br>communicate their roles in order to improve productivity and avoid coding something twice unnecessarily.<br>

Sexual consent is the mutual agreement between two partners at all points during sexual activity (Rainn). Ideally, <br> the agreement should be clearly given verbally between any two partners. Depending on the situation, such as a <br> long-term relationship, there can be clear physical cues to show the comfort level. However, consent becomes hazy <br>when there is hesitant action, alcohol involved, or nonverbal cues. Did she say yes? I think she did… When situations <br>arise where the victim is intimidated or agreement is forced, “consent” does not count. In random hookups or new <br>relationships, consent needs to be clear because the relationship and limits have not been defined. <br> <br>

A popular #MeToo case corresponds with the recent appointment of Judge Kavanaugh who was accused by Blasey Ford of sexual<br> assault while he was at a college party at Yale. When Kavanaugh was appointed to Supreme Court, Ford realized her <br>responsibility to the American public to share what she knows about his character before being put in a lifetime position<br> of power (Gay, Fandos). The motive of Kavanaugh of denying his actions is an example of loss aversion -- he does not <br> want to lose his position or reputation. He denied accusations because he believes he is qualified despite mistakes <br>that happened over 25 years ago. <br><br>

Recently, apps like Good2Go and Legal Fling have been developed and released to address the pressing issue of sexual <br>assault (Hess, Zarya). While there are technicalities that may hinder the trustworthiness of these apps in court, they <br>provide a jumping off point to start the conversation. Social media like Twitter and Youtube have also assisted with the <br> #MeToo conversation by empowering anyone to share their stories and bring previous assaults into the public <br>spotlight. These platforms have their caveats -- “victims” may present false information, which would saturate these <br>platforms with misleading information that detracts from the original intent of the #MeToo movement. While there is no <br>single solution that can solve any sexual assault case, technology has certainly made the conversation about sexual <br>assault relevant and streamlined the path to justice for true victims. <br><br>
