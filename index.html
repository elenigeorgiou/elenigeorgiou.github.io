	In the past few years, data collection in software has gotten a lot of attention. The acceptable line of data collection for convenience occurs when it goes beyond the scope of what a consumer agrees to. The tech industry plays a major part in this question as companies create applications that can harvest and use individuals’ personal information. Companies must decide how to use data they collect. 
<br><br>

By trading software access and information for personal data, individuals benefit from the convenience that applications create. For instance, from a consequentialist standpoint, by allowing Location Services, Google can offer you more intelligent recommendations such as show you where you parked your car or give suggestions for restaurants. However, individuals might feel that their privacy is compromised and that their information is being exploited which could pose security issues. There are always unintentional consequences that arise --- on a societal scale, data that gets into the wrong hands could be used maliciously. Because of this trade-off, society must decide how we want to deal with the data.  
<br><br>
There has been a lot of debate over data privacy and who should own personal data. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a data protection policy enforced by the European Union that sets guidelines regarding the collection and processing of personal data for individuals in the EU. GDPR has made headlines the past few years about attempting to set boundaries on how companies can use people’s personal data. Our group believes that companies should disclose to their consumers how their data is being collected and used, and offer to delete the data if the consumer does not consent to these practices.
<br><br>
As specified on the GDPR website, data privacy consent is informed and specific. Customers should know the data controller’s identity, what kind of data it will process, how it will be used, and be informed about their right to withdraw consent at any time. Informed consent means that the data-controlling agent must disclose the motivation behind getting personal data and receive the consumer’s consent prior to collecting data; additionally, revoking consent should be just as easy as giving it.

Software piracy does more bad than good. The ones that benefit short-term from piracy are only the individuals that choose to use it. These individuals that pirate software don’t realize the larger long-term impact on the product itself, the company, people in the company, and other genuine customers. 
<br><br>
People justify piracy to themselves because they think the money from just their copy of the game is so insignificant that it will barely affect the development company that they are ripping off. Especially for a small price tag on a game like Game Dev Tycoon, one small sale couldn’t possible harm the developers in their mind. They fail to realize however that everyone pirating the game adds up, and can make a significant dent in the sales margin of a game or other digital medium.  The consequences that arise from piracy include potentially bankrupting the company and stopping the product from being developed further. This in turn could lead to more ads to pay off the cost of producing the game or the increase of annoying pay-to-play mechanics.  
<br><br>
Technology has made piracy very easy and accessible. Anyone with a internet connection and computer can download games and watch movies/shows for no cost. Through the use of VPN and proxies, people can avoid getting in trouble with law officials and game/movie publishers. The ease of access and distribution that technology provides is essentially what makes the profit loss for software development companies stack up. For the individuals who pirate, their thinking might align with a virtue based framework in the sense that they are giving access to individuals who genuinely cannot afford a particular piece of software. However, individuals how can afford a piece of software should pay for it according to a consequentialist framework, as their decisions can cumulatively have a substantial impact. Excessive piracy may result in companies raising the average cost of game to make up for the losses due to illegal sharing of their game.

Youtube has a responsibility to provide an enjoyable platform that allows users to watch and share videos freely, while still upholding company policies. Their responsibility to advertisers is to provide advertising space that is not associated with content that hurts their image. 
<br><br>
The content on YouTube is a responsibility of both the platforms content creators and YouTube itself. The conversation about YouTube’s content is largely controlled by the creators who use YouTube to publish and monetize their content.  These creators discuss YouTube’s practices of demonetization and censorship on their content, bringing awareness of the situation from a creator’s perspective. Framing the discussion from a creator’s point of view allows for alternate framing of the situation, from that of advertisers and from YouTube itself. 
<br><br>
Advertisers have a right to keep their name away from content that could be harmful or controversial to themselves, while YouTube has a responsibility to uphold this right in order to keep its content monetized and funded. Since Youtube does not want to lose their clients which provide company revenue, they tend to demonetize videos even if they are slightly questionable. Google’s fundamental goal is to make correct information available to others, thus Youtube should not make money off videos that misinform and spread fake news.
<br><br>
Youtube’s profit model is based on a duty-based ethical framework as it finds a good balance between balancing having a platform that content can be freely shared while acknowledging capitalism and advertisers needs. YouTube has demonetized Alex Jones’ channel, InfoWars after he posted several extremely controversial videos. Demonetization was an appropriate action as it punishes Jones for spreading blatant misinformation and hurtful messages throughout the internet. And though several content creators have reported that YouTube has wrongly demonetized their videos for no reason, Youtube can work to fix these issues.

According to a New York Times article by Ceylan Yeginsu, Amazon has developed wristbands that track the productivity<br> of its factory workers. In general, the wristband concept is not unethical. From a consequentialist framework, <br>Amazon is simply smoothening out human inefficiencies in its factories. The bracelets are assisting workers with <br>their labor and highlighting which workers may be wasting company resources by being idle.  However, the possible<br> applications Amazon can use the wristband for are potentially unethical.  Amazon claims the wristbands are <br>designed to assist the workers in locating a package through haptic feedback, however, the technology required to do<br> this forces Amazon to track their employees’ every move.  This would be an invasion of employees’ privacy and <br>could lead to unethical oversight of employees.  Amazon also has ten percent of its Ohio employees relying on food <br>stamps.  As a large business that receives outrageous tax breaks, Amazon has not only the financial ability but <br>also the duty to its community and employees to respect and keep food on the plates of the people who make <br>Amazon's efficiency possible.<br>
<br>
Our society enables Amazon because of capitalism; consumers want efficiency -- and Amazon provides just that. <br>Fulfilling this need for consumers, allows them to have a lot of freedom in doing what they want. However, as a <br>result of receiving business subsidies and tax-break incentives, Amazon has a duty to help the local community and <br>its economy. Based on a duty-based framework, Amazon’s role as a tech giant and influencer, Amazon has the duty <br>to give back to communities they have disrupted. Because Amazon has had free reign over the market, they have <br>caused many local businesses to go out of business. Amazon should find a way to support local businesses and <br>encourage their growth. <br>

Technology’s role has the potential to harm work culture and overall ethics of working conditions in the Amazon <br>warehouses. Although technology is helping workers become more efficient, it is also developing an environment where <br>workers feel like they are always under pressure and scrutiny. <br>

The Challenger Disaster is a prime example of a costly ethical decision that killed several astronauts.<br>The engineers that understood the complex technology gave warnings to their higher-ups. They understood <br>that a technical detail could have a major impact on the launch of the rocket and astronauts on board, <br>and as a result, decided to warn the executives through a duty-based value system. Despite giving strong <br>warnings (that were ignored), the engineers didn’t do anything more -- a consequentialist view since <br>any other actions could have resulted in the loss of a job. Though the engineers did good in warning <br>their superiors of the technical red flag, they succumbed to obedience over a higher authority -- an <br>action that is common in our society. <br>
<br>
Those that ultimately made the decision to launch the Challenger actively ignored warnings by the <br>engineers. The launch had already been delayed once, and the commanders did not want to waste any more<br> time. Furthermore, after the failed launch, the people in power failed to accept their faults. They simply <br>blamed Boisjoly for “airing the company’s dirty laundry’ in front of the whole country. ” They ignored <br>warnings by engineers and told the public the cause of the disaster was due to flaws in decision <br>making. This exemplifies the consequentialist framework of the ethical decision process. The selfish <br>attitudes of the upper management and their urge to report success caused them to ignore technical details <br> they did not understand. They risked human life and months of hard work for a few moments of glory. <br> 
<br>
In situations such as these, it is quite imperative to listen to the advice of technical experts. For <br>NASA, individuals who coordinated the mission, including Morton Thiokol, to launch as soon as possible. <br>Utilizing a consequentialist framework, the hypothetical success they envisioned in the future would <br>ultimately justify their desire to rush Challenger’s launch, even when seven human <br>

According to a TechCrunch article by Alex Wilhelm and Alexia Tsotsis, well-known programmer Julie Horvath joined GitHub back in the year 2012. Initially, GitHub was a small<br>startup that was quite supportive of its female developers. However, she could not get used to the aggressive communication from her male colleagues that had been the norm<br>since the majority of the company was up to that point. As the company grew, Horvath felt that her work was not truly valued due to her gender. Having rejected a date, <br>unnecessary competition was created between the Horvath and the other engineer. The male engineer “ripped out (Horvath’s) code”  without giving her any credit. This toxic <br>culture continued to develop at Github as a result of no action by management. <br>
<br>
A duty-based ethical framework can be applied to this situation. Horvath claims that she was supportive of GitHub’s positive culture to feminists throughout her two-year-long<br> employment. Despite her claims that she was being harassed by upper-management, Horvath could have been silent about her situation as she must have felt an obligation to <br>support her company. Her silence and support of the company hid her discrimination, allowing it to continue.<br>
<br>

As discussed in Fowler’s article about women’s representation in Uber, the company failed to keep a women-welcoming organization as the company grew.  From the anecdotes told <br>by #ubersurvivors, the organization had a culture that sexualized women that was encouraged by upper management. By the time Fowler had quit Uber, women percentage in the <br>organization had dropped from 25% to 3%. With no changes stemming from management, the culture can only get worse because the entire industry suffers from the same issue. 7 <br>out of 10 women in tech startups report sexual harassment, while just 35 percent of men agree (Weisul). Uber only became proactive about women after they were criticized about<br> their environment and as a result, started to create programs. Through a consequentialist framework, the culture will continue to falter until management changes to ensure <br>it does not reflect poorly on the company as many consumers will not want to support a company that is discriminatory.<br>

Bob could have acted this way due to an egotistical character flaw. He might have assumed that his coding skills were superior to <br>Alice’s and therefore, his code should be implemented instead of hers. This places Carlos in a difficult position in this disagreement <br> as he believes in Alice’s ability to code. He perhaps even feels more comfortable working with Alice because Bob does not <br>collaborate well. Alice may feel that Bob’s actions were unfair and that he was too quick to assume her code was inadequate. Even if <br> the genders of the individuals were switched, if Bob is inherently an egotistical person, this same scenario can arise. There is also <br> the chance that Bob was more provoked to not accept Alice’s code due to false assumptions that gender affects her abilities to code.<br>
<br>
This sort of incident can affect both the relationships within the group and harm their individual self-confidence. Alice might feel<br>like she is not good enough or likes an “imposter” by Bob for not accepting her code.  Bob may even feel hurt as well for being <br>isolated, and not being able to understand code he’s told is clear and correct.<br>
<br>
The long term effects of this incident may deteriorate interpersonal communication. Alice and Carlos might feel that Bob is unlikely to <br> accept their future ideas because Bob was quick to demonstrate that he could completely dismiss someone’s work and ideas. <br>Furthermore, the group might not be as productive due to trust issues between members. <br>
<br>
Bob should let Alice explain her code, perhaps by adding better comments. He should apologize for being quick to judge and be <br>open-minded when listening to Alice’s explanation. In an attempt to make the code better, Alice and Bob could merge their code or test<br> to see which one is better.  In order for the group to remain productive, it is crucial for Bob to integrate into Alice’s code and <br>put ego aside. Carlos could step in and offer a different explanation of Alice’s code. All three members can take steps to better <br>communicate their roles in order to improve productivity and avoid coding something twice unnecessarily.<br>

Sexual consent is the mutual agreement between two partners at all points during sexual activity (Rainn). Ideally, <br> the agreement should be clearly given verbally between any two partners. Depending on the situation, such as a <br> long-term relationship, there can be clear physical cues to show the comfort level. However, consent becomes hazy <br>when there is hesitant action, alcohol involved, or nonverbal cues. Did she say yes? I think she did… When situations <br>arise where the victim is intimidated or agreement is forced, “consent” does not count. In random hookups or new <br>relationships, consent needs to be clear because the relationship and limits have not been defined. <br> <br>

A popular #MeToo case corresponds with the recent appointment of Judge Kavanaugh who was accused by Blasey Ford of sexual<br> assault while he was at a college party at Yale. When Kavanaugh was appointed to Supreme Court, Ford realized her <br>responsibility to the American public to share what she knows about his character before being put in a lifetime position<br> of power (Gay, Fandos). The motive of Kavanaugh of denying his actions is an example of loss aversion -- he does not <br> want to lose his position or reputation. He denied accusations because he believes he is qualified despite mistakes <br>that happened over 25 years ago. <br><br>

Recently, apps like Good2Go and Legal Fling have been developed and released to address the pressing issue of sexual <br>assault (Hess, Zarya). While there are technicalities that may hinder the trustworthiness of these apps in court, they <br>provide a jumping off point to start the conversation. Social media like Twitter and Youtube have also assisted with the <br> #MeToo conversation by empowering anyone to share their stories and bring previous assaults into the public <br>spotlight. These platforms have their caveats -- “victims” may present false information, which would saturate these <br>platforms with misleading information that detracts from the original intent of the #MeToo movement. While there is no <br>single solution that can solve any sexual assault case, technology has certainly made the conversation about sexual <br>assault relevant and streamlined the path to justice for true victims. <br><br>
